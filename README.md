# Bank CLI

A simple bank console application that allows users to create accounts and perform various transactions with their account.

- Load all accounts from file on startup

- Password currently has no constraint (for quick testing)
- Check for duplicate accounts during creation
- Functions would keep stacking on each other (find way to resolve)
